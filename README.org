#+TITLE: Hi! I'm MaterialFuture
#+AUTHOR: MaterialFuture

I'm a Full-Stack Developer that also specializes in Software Development and User Experience Research.

** Some Things I Like
- I Enjoy working with Crystal Lang to create new tools for myself and possibly others
- Emacs is where I do almost anything that isn't browser-based
- LaTeX and org-mode are what I use for anything document related, everything else is bloat
- I advocate heavily for a more information/text focused web
