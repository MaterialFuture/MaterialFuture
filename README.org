#+TITLE: Hi! I'm MaterialFuture
#+AUTHOR: MaterialFuture
I'm a Software Developer, UX Researcher, and enjoy working with Linux Systems.
** Some Things About Myself
- I write shell scripts a lot
- I enjoy working with Lisps, be it SBCL Common Lisp, EmacsLisp, or Chicken Scheme
- Emacs is where I do almost anything that isn't specifically browser-based (although there is ~eww~ for those things)
- LaTeX and Org-Mode are what I use for anything document related
- I advocate heavily for a more information/text focused web so less ads and more content

If you want to learn more about what I do then just visit my site that contains blog posts, wiki entries, and links to all my projects.
