#+TITLE: Hi! I'm MaterialFuture
#+AUTHOR: MaterialFuture
I'm a Linux SysAdmin that dabbles a bit in programming.
** Some Things About Myself
- I mainly write shell scripts
- I enjoy working with Lisps, be it SBCL Common Lisp or EmacsLisp
- Emacs is where I do almost anything that isn't specifically browser-based (although there is ~eww~)
- Currently working on a fork of LARBS for Arch people that like emacs + StmpWM
- LaTeX and Org-Mode are what I use for anything document related (No GROFF/TROFF here)
- I advocate heavily for a more information/text focused web so less ads more actual content to read - a la Gemini/Gopher protocols

If you want to learn more about what I do then just visit my site that contains blog posts, wiki entries, and links to all my projects.
