#+TITLE: Hi! I'm MaterialFuture
#+AUTHOR: MaterialFuture
I'm a SysAdmin, Musician that dabble in programming.
** Some Things About Myself
- I mainly write boring shell scripts
- I enjoy working with Lisps, be it SBCL Common Lisp or elisp
- Emacs is where I do almost anything that isn't browser-based
- Currently working on a fork of LARBS for people that like emacs
- LaTeX and Org-Mode are what I use for anything document related
- I advocate heavily for a more information/text focused web so less ads more actual content to read

If you want to learn more about what I do then just visit my site that contains blog posts, wiki entries, and links to all my projects.
